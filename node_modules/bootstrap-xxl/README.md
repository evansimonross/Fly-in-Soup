Bootstrap 4 with two additional breakpoints:

- `xxl` - `min-width: 1900px` (desktops at full screen)
- `xxxl` - `min-width: 3000px` (4k at full or near full screen)

Use these as you would other breakpoints, e.g. `<div class='col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4 col-xl-3 col-xxl-2'>`.  The `container` `max-width` is increased for these breakpoints as well.  See it in action at [bootstrap-xxl.com](https://bootstrap-xxl.com).

To use, simply download and link `dist/css/bootstrap.min.css` and `dist/js/bootstrap.min.js`, or the non-minified or bundled version if you prefer.

Now available from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap-xxl)!

`npm install bootstrap-xxl`
